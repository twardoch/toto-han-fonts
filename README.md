# Toto fonts
This repository hosts “last good” (from my perspective) versions of Adobe’s [Source Han Sans fonts](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/) v1.001 from September 12, 2014, which were published under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). After that date, the license was changed to OFL. The Apache 2 license allows very flexible creation of derivative works, while the OFL license is more copyleft and prohibits certain use cases. 

The `src` folder is the contents of [1.001R](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/archive/1.001R.zip) while the `otf` folder is the contents of [1.001](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/archive/1.001.zip).
